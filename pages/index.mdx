# Daniel Broderick

and welcome to my corner of the internet!

...Which I don't really need. Seriously, I don't blog or do freelance, so I don't 
know what to put here besides my resume. But hey, daniel-broderick.com was only $12 so I just
had to buy the domain. Maybe I'll dig up some of my old projects and host them here, but 
right now I'm busy working on [Negosh](https://negosh.tech) (coming June 2023). 


I'm not actively looking, but I'll always consider a compelling job offer.
