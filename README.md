# Portfolio Starter Kit

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio. 

# Setup
If you'd like to use this library yourself:
`git clone https://github.com/Danjoe4/resume-site.git`
`cd resume-site`
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

Then change the content in pages/index.mdx
